## Are You Following the Right News-Outlet? A MachineLearning based approach for outlet prediction

This project is an approach to recommend a list of probable outlets covering an event of interest. 

### Requirements and Setup

Python version >= 3.7
```
git clone https://github.com/Swati17293/outlet-prediction.git 
cd outlet-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
To run this project go through the following steps:

### Vectorize the data for future use
```
python3 src/vectorize_data.py
```
